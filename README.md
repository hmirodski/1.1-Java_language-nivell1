📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This project contains two Java exercises demonstrating fundamental Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
Exercise 1: Musical Instruments
Implement an abstract Instrument class with three concrete subclasses (wind, string, percussion). Demonstrate Java's class loading mechanism using static initialization blocks, showing that classes load only once—either by instantiation or static member access.
Exercise 2: Car
Create a Car class showing differences between static final, static, and final variables. Implement one static method (brake()) and one instance method (accelerate()). Demonstrate which variables can be initialized in constructors and how to invoke both method types.

Core Concepts: Class loading, static vs instance members, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism.
